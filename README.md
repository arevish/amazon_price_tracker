# Amazon Price Tracker ![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)

In this project we made a simple web scraping tool using **Beautiful soup** and **Python Request library**. Which regularly checks the price of an item and when the price does go down it send an Email to the user alerting them that the price has decreased.

This is a great project for someone who is interested by the concept of web scraping and the endless amount of project you could do with it.
